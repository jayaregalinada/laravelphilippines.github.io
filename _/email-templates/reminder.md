### Hey \*|FNAME|\*!

See you later at 7pm! Tip: leave a little early today to beat the rainy-day, 
    school-just-started traffic.

### The venue

The meetup will be held at the Coins.ph offices at [Centerpoint
Condominium][map]. It is situated in middle of Ortigas CBD. Bring an ID just in
case. Just say you're in for the Manila.js meetup as sponsored by Coins.ph.

> 12th floor, Centerpoint Condominium<br>
> Garnett St. cor. Julia Vargas, Ortigas

Regards,<br>
Rico & the Manila.js team
