# Submit a talk

The Manila.js community would be nothing if not for the people who share their stories.

## Can I talk?

Yes you may! Everyone with a story to tell is welcome to share. No previous
speaking experience is required. We'll be happy to help you figure out your
topic and presentation, too.

----

## Choosing a topic

There is no limit to what a topic can be. All we ask is that you share
something that a community of web developers would find interesting. Here are
some suggestions:

* **Something you learned recently.** Did you just research on a new
 technology? Tell us about your process of learning it. Try not to share too
 much about API details (people can Google for that), but focus on the things
 you found interesting, the problems you found challenging, and the output
 you've built from it.

* **A project you're proud of.** Tell us about something you've built either
  for work or for yourself. Share about your process of building it, as well
  as the problems you may have encountered along the way.

## What makes a good talk

Don't talk about a technology, tell the story of *what you did* with that technology.

Nobody ever left a conference talk with enough information in their head to
write a program from what they learned. For obvious practical reasons people
learn and continue to follow documentation while writing software. Don't try to
teach people what is already in the documentation, tell them a story that makes
them care enough to follow up with that technology.

## Format & Audience

Talks are 20 minutes. There is will be a short Q&A after.
