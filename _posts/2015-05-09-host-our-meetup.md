# Host our Manila.js meetup!

Manila.js, the Philippine JavaScript developers meetup group, is always looking 
for venues to hold our events. Here's some basic information on our meetups.

### Schedule

Our next meetup is on `August 7, 2015`. The event is typically scheduled 
on the first Friday of the month.

### Attendees

The meetup attracts design and web development professionals coming in after
their work. These are people who spend their career building web and mobile
applications, both as contractual freelancers and full-time employees.
There are also students, educators, and non-tech professionals.

We cap registrations depending on the capacity of the venue to prevent going
over-capacity. Here's our past head counts:

* Jan 2013 (Mint College): ~110 attendees
* Nov 2014 (Acropolis, Eastwood): ~85 attendees
* May 2015 (A Space, Makati): ~65 attendees

### Time slot
Our programme takes 2 hours. The usual time slot is 7pm to 9pm.

### Programme
There will be 3 talks, each taking 20 minutes. There will be two 20 minute 
breaks in between for socializing and snacks.

What we need
------------

### Seats:
Seats for the attendees are highly preferred, but they often don't mind standing up if needed.

### Tech requirements:
Video projector and microphone equipment are preferred, but not required.

### Registration booth area:
We'll have volunteers man the registration booths in the front desk. This is to count their attendance and provide the attendees with name tags.

What about food?
----------------

Manila.js is an effort by the community, for the community. Our food is 
typically sponsored by some generous attendees and local startups. As food 
sponsors, they get rights to being promoted in Manila.js announcements.

### After-drinkup
Some attendees would like to socialize after the event, so we often designate a 
nearby bar so they can hang out afterwards. This is often a KKB affair, though 
some generous patrons offer to sponsor drinks for people as well.
