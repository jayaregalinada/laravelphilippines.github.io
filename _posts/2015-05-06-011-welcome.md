### Getting there by car

The place within the vicinity of Greenbelt 5. The nearest parking areas are Greenbelt 1's car park building and Greenbelt 5's.

### Commuting to the venue

There are FX's around Metro Manila that can take you to Makati ("Ayala"). Be sure to alight close to Greenbelt 5.

Alternatively, you can take the MRT. From the Ayala station, it's a [1km walk](https://goo.gl/maps/bWddx) (15 mins) that you can do indoors via SM → Glorietta → Landmark → Greenbelt.

there's also a jeep terminal along the right side of MRT Ayala (northbound) beside Shell. The "Washington" jeep goes thru Ayala, and would stop along Greenbelt.

## Schedule

Registration starts at 7PM. The programme starts at 7:15PM sharp, so don't be late.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask me. Just reply to this email, or send me a text at 0908 8648125, or tweet to @rstacruz. I'll help you out in any way I can.

Regards,<br>
Rico & the Manila.js team
