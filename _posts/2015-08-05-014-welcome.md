> Time: **7:30PM**

### Mayon Studios

Our meetup for this month is sponsored by the fantastic people of [Mayon Studios, Inc](https://www.facebook.com/MayonStudios).

### Getting there by car

Make your way to the vicinity of McKinley road (near Malcolm's Deli and where Ristra's used to be), then keep going as if you're headed to Lawton Avenue. Turn left to 21st drive.

I'm a terrible driver by the way, so my instructions may be awful.

There will be parking in the building for a nominal fee.

## Schedule

Registration starts at 7:30PM. The programme starts at 7:45PM sharp, so don't be late! It might be raining so bring an umbrella.

## Reach out

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask me. Just reply to this email, or send me a text at 0908 8648125, or tweet to @rstacruz. I'll help you out in any way I can.

You can also join us on [Phackers slack](http://phackers.io) at the `#javascript` room.

Regards,<br>
Rico & the Manila.js team
