# Speaker reminders

Hi speakers!

Manila.js is happening today so I hope you’re getting your talks ready. Let me give you a few reminders for the event:

* __Time allotted:__ Up to 30 minutes for each of you.

* __Venue details__: Details and commuting instructions are in the [reminder emails][welcome] if you missed it.

* __Display:__ We’ll have a projector for the event.

* __Cables:__ The display supports VGA input. We’ll have a VGA cable and an VGA-to-Thunderbolt adaptor provided. If your computer doesn’t support any of these, let me know.

* __Wifi:__ There will be wifi available for you if you need it, but not to all the participants.

* __Microphone:__ No mics provided today.

* __Gamma:__ If your screen is too dark or too light for the projector, I recommend using the [Gamma Control] utility (free, OSX) to adjust your screen if necessary.

I suggest coming to the venue a little earlier so you may check if your computer works with our setup.

Above all, be sure to have fun! Preparing for your talk may be stressful, but it is very rewarding to know you’ll be enriching some people’s lives with your insights. Don’t be nervous, you’ll be among friends and I’ll be around to help with anything.

Also, my number is 0908-864-8125, feel free to contact me for any concerns you may have.

Cheers and see you later!<br>
Rico
